# Phone Forwarding Library

This project, developed as an individual programming assignment at the University of Warsaw, implements a library for managing phone number redirection operations. It allows users to add and remove phone number forwarding rules, retrieve redirected numbers, and handle complex reverse lookups. The library is implemented in **C** and thoroughly documented with **Doxygen**.

### Key Features
- **Phone Number Redirection:** Supports prefix-based redirection, enabling redirection of all numbers sharing a common prefix.
- **Reverse Lookup:** Provides functionality to find all numbers redirected to a specific number.
- **Memory Management:** Efficient handling of memory allocation and cleanup for phone number sequences.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Doxygen comments are used throughout the codebase, detailing the API and usage of each function and structure.
